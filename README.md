# Download and preprocess data
We will be focusing on the TCGA dataset. For the rna-seq data, we download it through PANCAN; for the microarray data, we download them through the GEO. Details of the datasets can be found in the google sheet stated above.

Expression data are stored in `./exprs/`

TODO: `./raw_exprs/` actually contains preprocessed data (frma)..
