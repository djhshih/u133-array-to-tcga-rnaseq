# Download and preprocess data
We will be focusing on the TCGA dataset. For the rna-seq data, we download it through PANCAN; for the microarray data, we download them through the GEO.

Expression and phenotype annotation are stored in `./exprs`

TODO: move the annotation tables into a different folder called `./annot`?
