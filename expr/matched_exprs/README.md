# Matched exprs

This directory contains matched rna-seq and microarray expression (matched by genes and patients), as well as some exploration on the relationships between the two type of expression.

In each directory, there are 2 scripts:
1. match.R
2. explore.R

Please run `match.R` first to match the expression data, followed by `explore.R` to explore the relationship.
